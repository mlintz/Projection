@class PRJRect;

/** A mapping class for associating projectables (views and layers) with PRJRects.

PRJMapping behaves like an NSMutableDictionary with the following exceptions:

- PRJMapping retains keys instead of copying them.
- PRJMapping copies PRJValues instead of retaining them.
- objectForKeyedSubscript will create and store a new PRJRect instead of returning nil if there
  isn't a value associated with a projectable. This means that clients will rarely have to create
  PRJRects on their own.

Invoking "apply" iterates through all entries and sets the rect's integralFrame as the
projectable's frame.

Usage:
    PRJMapping *mapping = [[PRJMapping alloc] init];
    mapping[someView].size = CGSizeMake(50, 50);  // A new PRJRect is automatically created;
    mapping[someView].topLeft = CGPointMake(10, 20.1234);
    [mapping apply];
    CGRect frame = someView.frame;  // frame = (10 20; 50 50);
